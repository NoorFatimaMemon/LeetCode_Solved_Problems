"""You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.
Example 1: Input: n = 5, Output: 2, Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2: Input: n = 8, Output: 3, Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
 
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 231 - 1"""
